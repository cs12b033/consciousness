= Introduction =

As-is, this code iteratively generates all partitions for a set of up to n elements for n<=15.  If you want to go higher than 15 elements you can replace `unsigned int` with `unsigned long` and most things will _just work_.  Note that if you're going higher than 15 elements the number of partitions is greater the maximum size of an unsigned int.

One could hypothetically make this implementation even faster by creating a separate class for each value of n and #define the network_size
